                    HealthDeck was founded in 2020 by CTRLALTDEV based on years of experience, continuous research and development. This has culminated in a product that is used and trusted by practitioners and medical administrators all over Southern Africa.
              The suite of HealthDeck medical administration and billing software was developed by a company filled with people who know and understand medical practice administration and management.</p> 
              
              <p>HealthDeck has more than 10 employees and we take pride in having plenty of experience in the medical and development fields. This combination allowed us to develop a product that is easy to use, secure, accurate and integrated. This, in turn, frees medical practitioners up to focus on their areas of speciality while our software facilitates the workflow in the office.</p>
                    
              
              <h4><i>About Software:</i></h4>
              <p>HealthDeck is a complete and unified web application for every role in the medical practice. Simplified billing, flexible scheduling, insightful reporting and easy-to-use patient relationship management tools.</p>

              <h4><i>Why HealthDeck?</i></h4>
              
                    <ul>
                      <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Web-based: </li>
                <p>Access your data from anywhere, anytime from any device.
                Doctors can access patient information from any device, anywhere, anytime allowing you to improve patient care and accuracy of treatments. Multiple doctors can access a clientâ€™s medical records (provided they have permission to do so). This could mean the difference between life and death in emergency circumstances.</p>

                      <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Secured:</li>
                <p>Patient data is sensitive and private, therefore it is important to keep it safe. If data is stored on the web back-end it is protected from loss due to theft, breakage and malicious intent.</p>
                    
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Easy Accessibility:</li>
              <p>The HealthDeck solution provides remote, safe storage and access to all your data via the internet. This allows you to access any data from any devices, anywhere, anytime.
                We use real-time replication to improve failover time in the event of a disaster and also have offsite backups.
